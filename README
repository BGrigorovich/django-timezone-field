This app provides a TimeZoneField to save pytz.tzinfo.DstTzInfo objects.

Input can either be a pytz DstTzInfo object, or a string that validates
successfully against pytz.all_timezones.

Output is a pytz DstTzInfo object.

Objects are stored in the database as strings.
South support included.

Custom validators should be designed to validate a pytz DstTzInfo.
